This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or module from Expo that isn't compatible with your current setup (managed or bare workflow) or when there's a mismatch between the Expo SDK version and the native modules used in your project.  The error message itself might not directly point to the culprit, making debugging challenging.

Example (Illustrative):
```javascript
import * as WebBrowser from 'expo-web-browser';

// ... later in the code ...
WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync('https://example.com');
```

In a bare workflow, this might fail if `expo-web-browser` isn't correctly linked or configured. In a managed workflow, an older SDK version might lack necessary components.

Another example might involve using a native module that's incompatible with the current platform (iOS or Android).
