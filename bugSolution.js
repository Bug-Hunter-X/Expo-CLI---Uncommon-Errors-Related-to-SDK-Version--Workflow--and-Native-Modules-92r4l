To resolve compatibility-related Expo CLI errors, carefully review the following:

1. **Check Expo SDK Version:** Ensure you're using a compatible SDK version for your desired features and native modules. Refer to the Expo documentation for compatibility information.

2. **Managed vs. Bare Workflow:**  Understand the implications of each workflow. Bare workflows require more manual configuration of native modules.  Managed workflows handle much of the configuration automatically, but might have limitations on the use of some libraries.

3. **Native Module Linking (Bare Workflow):** If using a bare workflow, verify that all necessary native modules are correctly linked.  Consult the documentation for each native module for specific linking instructions.

4. **Dependency Management:** Use a package manager like npm or yarn for consistent management of dependencies and their versions.

5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes a clean build (removing `node_modules` and re-installing dependencies) can resolve unexpected issues.

6. **Examine Error Messages Carefully:** Even obscure error messages sometimes contain clues; parse these closely to potentially pinpoint the problem.

7. **Consult Expo Documentation:** The Expo documentation often contains troubleshooting information and solutions for common and uncommon errors.

Example (Illustrative solution for WebBrowser):

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import * as WebBrowser from 'expo-web-browser';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const openBrowser = async () => {
      try {
        await WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync('https://example.com');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error opening browser:', error);
        // Implement fallback or error handling
      }
    };
    openBrowser();
  }, []);

  return null; // or your component's JSX
}
```
This improved example incorporates error handling, which is essential when dealing with potential compatibility or runtime issues.
